## About the Proyect

The proyect is intended to be fully functional ToDo App API, it is designed into a 3 layer architecture, implementing a working realational database based on MySQL.


## Whats Next?
This is an almost finished proyect, yet these are some of the things that I'll get done in the future:
<ul>
  <li>Create pertinent models for the entities</li>
  <li>Clone the database into a NoSql model</li>
  <li>Create a validator as a middleware</li>
</ul>

## How to use API?

<ol>
  <li>First of all, run npm Install into the root directory of the proyect </li>
  <li>Second to that, after installing the dependencies, the next step is to locally mount the database in your preffered way</li>
  <li>Then in the root directory of ther app run node Index.js in order to start the API</li>
  <li>From here you are ready to use the App</li>
</ol>
